# Project Euler 031 - Coin Sums

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p).  There are eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1x£1 + 1x50p + 2x20p + 1x5p + 1x2p + 3x1p

The aim is to find the number of different ways that £2 or other value can be made using any number of coins.
